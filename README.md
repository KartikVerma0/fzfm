# Fzfm - Fuzzy file manager
This is a terminal file manager in the style of Ranger, nnn, lf, vifm, etc. It uses bash, fzf, and chafa
to display directory contents, preview the contents of the selected directory or file before entering
or opening, and preview images (poorly). 

###  Does well
- traverse file tree 
- preview files and directories 
- open files using different software based on file type
- create new files and directories

### Does (needs work)
- image preview
- delete files/directories

### Doesn't yet
- copy files/directories
- move directories
- extract/compress
